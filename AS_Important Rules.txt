---rules that heavily influence more sleep---

We can sleep longer if we know the commute will be short and we have a decent amount of time to sleep:
if (commuteT is veryShort) and (TtoSleep is average) then (SleepDuration is lots)
if (commuteT is short) and (TtoSleep is more/lots) then (SleepDuration is lots)
if (commuteT is average) and (TtoSleep is lots) then (SleepDuration is lots)

If we can get to sleep reasonably well, and we have a decent amount of time to sleep, we sleep more:
if (easeSleep is normal) and (TtoSleep is lots) then (SleepDuration is lots)
if (easeSleep is easy) and (TtoSleep is more/lots) then (SleepDuration is lots)

If our commute is short, and we get to sleep very easily, we can sleep more of the time available:
if (commuteT is veryShort) and (easeSleep is normal/easy) then (SleepDuration is lots)
if (commuteT is short) and (easeSleep is easy) then (SleepDuration is lots)

---rules that heavily influence less sleep---

If we know we have long to travel, and little time to sleep, we can't use as much of the available time:
if (commuteT is average/long/verylong) and (TtoSleep is veryLittle) then (SleepDuration is veryLittle)
if (commuteT is verylong) and (TtoSleep is Little) then (SleepDuration is veryLittle)

If it is hard to sleep, and we have little time to sleep, then we can't sleep for as long:
if (easeSleep is hard) and (TtoSleep is little/veryLittle) then (SleepDuration is veryLittle)

If the commute is long, and it's hard to fall asleep, then we can't sleep for as long:
if (commuteT is verylong) and (easeSleep is hard) then (SleepDuration is veryLittle)
