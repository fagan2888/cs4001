---rules that heavily influence easiness of falling asleep---

We will more easily fall asleep if we have slept little the day before (all rules except one that include slept little day before have easy as output).
If (LastMealOrDrink is SomeTimeAgo) and (SleptDayBefore is Little) and (ActivityDuringDay is ALot) then (EasinessOfFallingAsleep is Easy)
If (LastMealOrDrink is SomeTimeAgo) and (SleptDayBefore is Little) and (ActivityDuringDay is Normal) then (EasinessOfFallingAsleep is Easy)   
If (LastMealOrDrink is SomeTimeAgo) and (SleptDayBefore is Little) and (ActivityDuringDay is Little) then (EasinessOfFallingAsleep is Easy)  
If (LastMealOrDrink is JustNow) and (SleptDayBefore is Little) and (ActivityDuringDay is Little) then (EasinessOfFallingAsleep is Easy)      
If (LastMealOrDrink is JustNow) and (SleptDayBefore is Little) and (ActivityDuringDay is Normal) then (EasinessOfFallingAsleep is Easy)
If (LastMealOrDrink is JustNow) and (SleptDayBefore is Little) and (ActivityDuringDay is ALot) then (EasinessOfFallingAsleep is Easy)
If (LastMealOrDrink is LongTimeAgo) and (SleptDayBefore is Little) and (ActivityDuringDay is ALot) then (EasinessOfFallingAsleep is Easy)
If (LastMealOrDrink is LongTimeAgo) and (SleptDayBefore is Little) and (ActivityDuringDay is Normal) then (EasinessOfFallingAsleep is Easy)

Normality also leads to easily falling asleep
If (LastMealOrDrink is SomeTimeAgo) and (SleptDayBefore is Normal) and (ActivityDuringDay is Normal) then (EasinessOfFallingAsleep is Easy)
